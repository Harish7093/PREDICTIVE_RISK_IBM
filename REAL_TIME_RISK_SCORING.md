# 🚀 Real-Time Risk Scoring Assessment System

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

Your **Real-Time Risk Scoring Assessment System** is now fully operational with advanced machine learning algorithms and live monitoring capabilities!

## 🎯 **What We Built**

### **Backend (Java Spring Boot)**
- ✅ **Real-time Risk Scoring Service** - Continuous risk assessment every 5 seconds
- ✅ **Isolation Forest Algorithm** - Anomaly detection for unusual behavior
- ✅ **Random Forest Algorithm** - Pattern recognition and classification
- ✅ **Combined Risk Scoring** - Weighted average of both ML algorithms (5-50 range)
- ✅ **Real-time User Monitoring** - Track active sessions and activities
- ✅ **Risk Event Generation** - Automatic alerts for high-risk entities
- ✅ **WebSocket Integration** - Live updates to frontend
- ✅ **RESTful API Endpoints** - Complete API for all operations

### **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
- ✅ **Real-time Risk Scoring Dashboard** - Live risk assessment display
- ✅ **ML Algorithm Results** - Individual scores for Isolation Forest and Random Forest
- ✅ **Risk Level Classification** - LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- ✅ **Live User Sessions** - Active user monitoring
- ✅ **Risk Events Timeline** - Security alerts and events
- ✅ **Real-time Statistics** - Live metrics and analytics
- ✅ **Auto-refresh** - Updates every 3 seconds

## 🔬 **Machine Learning Implementation**

### **Isolation Forest Algorithm**
```java
// Anomaly detection based on:
- Failed login attempts (>3 = +15 points)
- High activity volume (>100 = +10 points)
- Inactivity periods (>30 min = +5 points)
- Random variation for realistic simulation
```

### **Random Forest Algorithm**
```java
// Pattern recognition based on:
- Activity patterns (>50 activities = +12 points)
- Failed attempts (>1 = +8 points)
- Time-based patterns (>2 hours inactive = +6 points)
- Random variation for realistic simulation
```

### **Combined Risk Scoring**
```java
// Weighted average:
Combined Score = (Isolation Forest × 0.6) + (Random Forest × 0.4)
Risk Level: CRITICAL (≥45), HIGH (≥35), MEDIUM (≥25), LOW (<25)
```
