# 🚀 Predictive Risk Scoring Assessment System - Status Report

## ✅ System Overview

Your **Predictive Risk Scoring Assessment System** is now **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** with both backend and frontend working together!

### 🎯 What We Built

**Backend (Java Spring Boot):**
- ✅ RESTful API with real-time endpoints
- ✅ Risk assessment using Isolation Forest and Random Forest algorithms
- ✅ Real-time user monitoring
- ✅ Dashboard statistics
- ✅ Entity management
- ✅ Security configuration (disabled for development)

**Frontend (React + TypeScript):**
- ✅ Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Real-time dashboard
- ✅ Entity list with risk assessment
- ✅ Real-time user monitoring
- ✅ Risk analysis features
- ✅ Responsive design

## 🔧 How to Start the System

### Option 1: Manual Start
1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Start Frontend (in new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd project
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Using the Test Script
```bash
.\test-system.ps1
```

## 🌐 Access Points

- **Frontend Dashboard:** http://localhost:5173

## 🔍 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Backend health check |
| `/api/dashboard/stats` | GET | Dashboard statistics |
| `/api/entities` | GET | List all entities |
| `/api/assess/{entityId}` | POST | Assess entity risk |
| `/api/users/active` | GET | Active users |
| `/api/real-time/stats` | GET | Real-time statistics |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Backend Won't Start:
1. Check if port 8080 is free
2. Run: `netstat -an | findstr :8080`
3. Kill any process using port 8080
4. Restart: `mvn spring-boot:run`

### If Frontend Won't Connect:
1. Ensure backend is running on port 8080
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API URL in `project/src/services/api.ts`

### If You See Connection Errors:
1. Backend is running but Spring Security might be blocking
2. Check the SecurityConfig.java file
3. Restart the backend
